Android powered mobile into a wireless trackpad and keyboard!!!

You can use the multi touch features.

I have used connectify in a windows 7 pc.

Update your pc's IP address in the 'SendMessageAsync' file in the android project.

Two finger tap - right click

Three finger drag and drop

Four fingers to show desktop.

Much more cool things will be added!


Thank you.
